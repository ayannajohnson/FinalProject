Every human life is valuable. We must be the solution.. Every human being has the right to gather in peaceful protestes without suffering more unnecceary violence to effect change we must show love in the face of hate and peace in the face of violence" On top of that beyonce opened the 2016 BET Awards with her song Freedom feat. Kendrick Lamar. This was a way for Beyonce to make a statment  in an area that she is thriving in so that all the attention was on her and the #BlackLivesMatter movement she is standing up for.

			<p>The beautiful Amandla Stenberg is only 17 years old and has made such an influence. She uses her platform as a young girl of color to advocate for girl power and black rights. Amandla is so inspirational to young people. She embraces her natural self and encourages others to be comfortable in their skin. She is a true Divergent Girl of Color. When asked about being a girl of color Amandla said  “I think that as a black girl you grow up internalizing all these messages that say you shouldn’t accept your hair or your skin tone or your natural features, or that you shouldn’t have a voice, or that you aren’t smart,” she says. “I feel like the only way to fight that is to just be yourself on the most genuine level. Just this week she was cast in Everything Everything.  MGM and Alloy Entertainment’s adaptation of the YA book by Nicola Yoon. Stenberg has officially closed his deal while Robinson is in final negotiations, according to insiders. </p>
