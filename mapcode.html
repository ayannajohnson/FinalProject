<!-- Beauty Tips -->
  <p>
Here on our map we have marked some great locations of stores that sell makeup for girls of color. Sephora Foxhills is the only carrier of the international brand BlackUp in Los Angeles. This glorious brand is very high end so it is not always the most affordable. The phenomnal quality makes up for the prices. The rich shades complement nubian skin perfectly and is a great option. Sephora is a great resource for beauty; however, there are other great places. Nordstrom carries Laura Mercier and  Nars. Laura Mercier has great products like their tinted moisturizer, secret concealer, and deluxe finishing powder. NARS cosmetics is a well known brand but the brand's foundations are appealing to women with darker skin tones because they offer both soft satin and matte finishes; meanwhile, the cult Creamy Concealer ($29) comes in a deep cocoa color that's perfect for brightening up under-eyes on darker skin tones. Ulta is also a great place to go it carries Bobbi Brown. Makeup artist Bobbi Brown is known for advocating for shades that look natural on a wide range of complexions and her namesake line never disappoints, specifically Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation SPF 15, $48, and Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Even Finish Compact Foundation, $46. Both products come in 20 shades, half of which range from tan to espresso and offer six variations of the darkest skin tones. Not all great brands are sold in mainstream stores. Instead of marking every drugstore location it is easier to just name them. Iman Cosemetics created by the legendary model is an affordable high quality brand.

      Beauty Tips 
    There are serveral ways to determine your foundation, lip, and eyeshadow color based off of undertones and nationality and even eye color. This can help not only with your makeup selection but also clothing color choices and accessories like the types of metals and which favorite headband will give Chritian with the nice smile a bette chance at recognizing you to find this quiz at the bottom of this paragraph will be a link to some of our favorite foundation, eyeshadow, and lipstick quizes and you can even link with a youtuber that has similar looks and skin. If you dont feel like doing endless clicking there is also a few we can give for certain eye colors.
    For GREENEYED Girls
    Avoid silver, leave black eyeliner alone and reach for a brown earthy tones really bring out the iris's (the part of your eyes with color) try some simple lihter earthy tones at first then if your feeling bold look up some daring looks of your favorite youtubers using smokey browns and green and even a dash of vibrant colors to bring out the best you.
    For BLUEEYED Girls
    Grays work for you pretty blue eyed Queens also look into coffee type browns and deeper colors for your set of eyes that contrast in color from light to dark to really bring out the inner you and show Christian who is really behind those eyes. A tiny tip that you may also know is mascara playing in different color mascara can really add to a look in the simplest way. 
    For DEEP BROWNEYED Girls 
    Yaaaaaaas the eye color most of us colored girls fall into so it must be a special color we may not always stand out in a crowed but oh are we special in our own individual ways. One of these special things is that most of all color make are eyes pop but one of the nicest color can really pop and een look good on the skin is golds and really vibrant and pigmented bronze colors. Any really deep shadows will actually bring out the eyes despite most thoughts giving your eyes that mystery we all like and black eyeliner is ALWAYS your friend defining those beautiful things.
    For MEDIUM BROWN to LIGHT BROWN/HAZEL EYED Girls
    Not only do our eyes vary in awesomness but there seem to sometimes be the pretty speck of color in the eyes making it something anyone can stare at forever. Try to avoid harsh black eyeliner though a pretty copper or metallic liner will give it that thang you were looking for. Eyeshdows just like the darker brown eyed girls are limitless for you. 
    BUT FOR ALL MY GIRLS.....
    Remember the world is your kingdom do and wear whatever you want despite what one looks liker is told you are beauiful and don't forget.
