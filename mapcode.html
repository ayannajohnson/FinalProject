  	<p class ="MAP">Here on our map we have marked some great locations of stores that sell makeup for girls of color.</p>
	<div class = "row">
    	<div class= "col-md-3">
    		<h2> SEPHORA</h2>
			Sephora Foxhills is the only carrier of the international brand BlackUp in Los Angeles. This glorious brand is very high end so it is not always the most affordable. The phenomnal quality makes up for the prices. The rich shades complement nubian skin perfectly and is a great option. Sephora is a great resource for beauty; however, there are other great places.
		</div>
    	<div class= "col-md-3">
    		<h2>NORDSTROM</h2>
 			Nordstrom carries Laura Mercier and  Nars. Laura Mercier has great products like their tinted moisturizer, secret concealer, and deluxe finishing powder. NARS cosmetics is a well known brand but the brand's foundations are appealing to women with darker skin tones because they offer both soft satin and matte finishes; meanwhile, the cult Creamy Concealer ($29) comes in a deep cocoa color that's perfect for brightening up under-eyes on darker skin tones.
 		</div>
    	<div class= "col-md-3">
    		<h2>ULTA</h2>
  			Ulta is also a great place to go it carries Bobbi Brown. Makeup artist Bobbi Brown is known for advocating for shades that look natural on a wide range of complexions and her namesake line never disappoints, specifically Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation SPF 15, $48, and Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Even Finish Compact Foundation, $46. Both products come in 20 shades, half of which range from tan to espresso and offer six variations of the darkest skin tones.
  		</div> 
	    <div class= "col-md-3">
	    	<h2>DRUGSTORE BRANDS</h2>
  			Not all great brands are sold in mainstream stores. Instead of marking every drugstore location it is easier to just name them. Iman Cosemetics created by the legendary model is an affordable high quality brand. This brand has so much versatility from allowing customers to build their base foundation, to every cosmetic tool. Iman Cosmetics is sold at Walgreens, CVS, and Target. Another awesome brand is Black Opal. Black Opal can be found locally at CVS, Walmart, and even Rite Aid. Covergirl Queen Collection by Queen Latifah is also a high quality brand sold at local stores. This is brand like Iman's is special becuase two powerful women of color are the face of the brand.

  <h1 align="center">Beauty Tips </h1>
    <p>
    	There are several ways to determine your foundation, lip, and eyeshadow color based off of undertones and nationality and even eye color. This can help not only with your makeup selection but also clothing color choices and accessories.
    </p>
    <div class = "row">
    	<div class= "col-md-6">
    		<h3> For BLUEEYED Girls</h3>
    		<p>
    			Avoid silver, leave black eyeliner alone and reach for a brown earthy tones really bring out the iris's (the part of your eyes with color). Try some simple lighter earthy tones at first then if your feeling bold look up some daring looks of your favorite youtubers using smokey browns and green and even a dash of vibrant colors to bring out the best you. 
    		</p>
    	</div>
    	<div class= "col-md-6">
    		<h3>For GREENEYED Girls</h3>
    		<p> 
    			Grays work for you pretty blue eyed Queens also look into coffee type browns and deeper colors for your set of eyes that contrast in color from light to dark to really bring out the inner you. A tiny tip that you may also know is mascara playing in different color mascara can really add to a look in the simplest way.
    		</p>
    	</div>
    </div>
    <div class = "row">
    	<div class= "col-md-6">
    		<h3>For DEEP BROWNEYED Girls</h3>	
   			<p> 
   				Yaaaaaaas the eye color most of us colored girls fall into so it must be a special color we may not always stand out in a crowed but oh are we special in our own individual ways. One of these special things is that most of all color make are eyes pop but one of the nicest color can really pop and een look good on the skin is golds and really vibrant and pigmented bronze colors. Any really deep shadows will actually bring out the eyes despite most thoughts giving your eyes that mystery we all like and black eyeliner is ALWAYS your friend defining those beautiful things.
   			</p>
   		</div>
   		<div class= "col-md-6">
   			<h3> For MEDIUM BROWN to LIGHT BROWN/HAZEL EYED Girls</h3>	
    		<p>
    			Not only do our eyes vary in awesomness but there seem to sometimes be the pretty speck of color in the eyes making it something anyone can stare at forever. Try to avoid harsh black eyeliner though a pretty copper or metallic liner will give it that thang you were looking for. Eyeshdows just like the darker brown eyed girls are limitless for you. 
    			BUT FOR ALL MY GIRLS.....
    			Remember the world is your kingdom do and wear whatever you want. You are beautiful and don't forget.
